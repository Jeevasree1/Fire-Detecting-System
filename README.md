# Fire Detecting System

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a fire detection system using Tinkercad for simulation purposes. The system is designed to detect the presence of fire through gas sensors, providing an early warning mechanism.

## Features

- **Fire Detection:** Utilizes gas sensors to detect the presence of smoke or flammable gases indicative of a fire.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the environment for any signs of fire.
- **Alarm System:** Triggers an alarm when a fire is detected, alerting users to potential danger.
- **Simulation:** Implemented and tested using Tinkercad, a robust platform for simulating electronic circuits.

## Components Used

- **Gas Sensor (MQ-2/MQ-5/MQ-7):** Detects smoke, LPG, CO, and methane.
- **Arduino Uno:** Microcontroller used for processing sensor data.
- **Buzzer:** Emits a sound when a fire is detected.
- **LED:** Visual indicator for fire detection status.
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires:** For creating the circuit.

## How It Works

1. **Sensor Calibration:** The gas sensor is calibrated to detect specific gas levels.
2. **Continuous Monitoring:** The Arduino continuously reads data from the gas sensor.
3. **Threshold Detection:** When the sensor readings exceed a predefined threshold, it indicates the presence of smoke or gas.
4. **Alarm Activation:** The system activates an alarm (buzzer and LED) to warn users of a potential fire.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the gas sensor to the Arduino using jumper wires.
   - Connect the buzzer and LED to the appropriate Arduino pins.
   - Ensure all components are securely connected on the breadboard.

2. **Software Setup:**
   - Install the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fire-detecting-system.git`.
   - Open the provided `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code to your Arduino Uno.

3. **Simulation in Tinkercad:**
   - Import the project file into Tinkercad.
   - Simulate the circuit to test the fire detection system.

## Usage

- **Monitoring:** Once the system is powered on, it will start monitoring for fire continuously.
- **Alarm:** If the sensor detects gas levels above the threshold, the buzzer will sound, and the LED will light up.
